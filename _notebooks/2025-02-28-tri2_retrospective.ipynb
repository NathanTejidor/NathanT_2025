    "Many reviews say that our website is very cool, interesting, and some even say that they will use the random recipes feature in order to plan their meals for the week. The only fix that someone reccomended was to have the UI a bit more organized. Which I can see where that is coming from as one thing that was bugging me a bit was that on some of the recipes, when u click to edit them you still have to scroll down to edit them which could be confusing if they forget to scroll.\n",

    "Overall I feel that I have grown a lot during this course, and I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills. I have learned how to use various tools such as postman in order to assist me in debugging and testing my code. However for the previous assignments, mainly the reviews I feel that I could have managed my time and worked with my team more than being more of a soloist which eventually changed along the way of the trimester, ultimately allowing both me and my group to get results. With that in mind I feel that for most topics I should be at a .9."
