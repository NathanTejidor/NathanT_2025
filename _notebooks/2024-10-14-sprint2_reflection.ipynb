    "# Sprint 2 Reflection\n",
    "During my time working on sprint 2 my team decided to choose lessons 3.6 and 3.7. My job was to teach if else statements and during my time making the lesson I used the Ap classroom lessons in order to learn about them myself until I was good enough to teach and explain it. Another thing was learning from the other student lessons. I learned a lot from the other student lessons which helped me to finally understand most of what the code given to us from sprint 1 does and why it is used. I have also added all my homeworks to blogs in order to reflect on them and possibly make them better in the future but also as notes to use later on.\n",
