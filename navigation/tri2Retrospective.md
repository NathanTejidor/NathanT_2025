## ✨ My 5 Accomplishments Over the 12 Weeks  

- ✅ **Basic static recipes** for users added for the main function of the website's random recipes.  
- ✅ **Testing APIs** using Postman before implementing them in the frontend. Learning what the messages in Postman mean, e.g., **<span class="highlight">404, 200, 201, and 500</span>**.  
- ✅ **Improving team work**, at first I worked more by myself which limited me.  
- ✅ **CPT Requirements:** Used a **dictionary** for recipe APIs, implementing **sequencing, iteration, and selection**.  
- ✅ **Tracking progress** with my team using a **Kanban board**.
