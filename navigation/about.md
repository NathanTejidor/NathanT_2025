My name is Nathan Tejidor. I am 15 and a sophomore at Del Norte Highschool. I am Filipino but I was born in San Diego. I enjoy playing basketball and badminton, listening to music and hanging out with my friends and family. I have 2 dogs, one is a sheprador mix and the other is a maltipoo. The sheprador is named Sabrina and the maltipoo is Chester.
