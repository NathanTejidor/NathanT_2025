# VS Code
During my journey of downloading everything for AP CSP I was successfully able to download vs code through the nighthawk setup page for MacOS. Along with the tools I need on VS Code. Python and Jupyter which were not very difficult to find, I simply searched them in the VS code search bar which allowed them to pop up and with a simple click I was able to install them.

# Home Brew
Home Brew was where I met struggle. During the installation of Home Brew I found that I was skipping steps which caused an error to be prompted after typing in the terminal command. The step I skipped where the 2 codes that needed to be run in terminal after copying and pasting the one on the nighhawk setup page. After I figured that out and completing all the steps, I was finally able to run home brew and verify it's installation.

# Portfolio Repository 
During my time attempting to make my nighthawk page, I was met with multiple errors due to me forgetting to change my cd. I chose the wrong one and I also did not add the code for running VS Code which caused me to be unable to do code . to open VS Code. After installing it through VS Code I was able to do code . and make a virtual environment so I could begin coding.
